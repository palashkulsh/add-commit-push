use this software to auto add, auto commit and push your files to git.

# usecase
my main usecase for creating this software was to create a writing pipeline for myself. I just wanted to write the file and save it. then it should automatically be pushed in git. this way i can continue to focus on what's important and remove the rest of the parts.

# getting started
 File -> add repository -> select your repo which you want to listen and add-commit-push periodically every 1 minute.

# Config Data persistence
this software creates a config file with the name git_auto_sync_config.json which is saved in the same directory as code. (can change it at a later point of time if this project actually gets used by me).
